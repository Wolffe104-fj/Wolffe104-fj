# Hello, folks!👋

My name is Michael and I'm a student, tutor, and computer scientist. In the past, I've also worked as an engineer and teacher. You can find me on social media where you can learn more about my work and life. Here, I want to tell you more about what I do, my interests, and my goals.

## ⚙️ Projects

*These are not all of my projects, but they are the ones that I am not ashamed to discuss. As time goes on, I will attempt to add other projects without an NDA to GitHub when I bring them to mind or finish them "as is".

### 🍀 [The relationship between multifactorial diseases and the microbiome (in the oral cavity)](https://github.com/Wolffe104-fj/BB25_Project_TRbMDatM)
This project was part of the Bioinformatics Bootcamp 2025 at ITMO University, which was my first experience participating in a hackathon or similar event. Although it was my first time trying something like this, I think the project turned out well, and most importantly, I gained a lot of knowledge and made new friends.
### 💊 Drug Design for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease
This project was created as part of DataCon 2025 "Artificial intelligence in the development of pharmaceutical molecules" from the Center for Chemistry and AI at ITMO University. The presented (old) version of the program can be found [here](https://github.com/Wolffe104-fj/DC25_FinalTask_EchoLab).
### 🔬 Drug Design for the Treatment of lung sarcoidosis
The pet-project that is currently being worked on, the results and the program code will be posted here over time.
### 💉 Program for modeling the fluid flow of a vessel with a giant aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery (MCA)
A pet-project inspired by one of the typical tasks for biomedical engineers from the MSMU Sechenov website
### 💉 [Program for modeling hemodynamics of a large circle of blood circulation](https://github.com/Wolffe104-fj/HemodynLCBC)
A pet-project inspired by one of the typical tasks for biomedical engineers from the MSMU Sechenov website

## ☕ Summary

My main field of interest is chemoinformatics and biomedical technology. I have always been passionate about chemistry and computer science since my school days, although it used to be considered a "bad set".

I also study related fields that are relevant to this area. For example, in cybersecurity, I learn about the protection of medical devices (MIoT) and other related topics, which helps me improve my skills in writing secure code. 

You may have a question about how GameDev ended up here. My career in IT began with a love of video games and editing files in them. In my free time, I enjoy developing games and creating mods for them.
